Lehigh Valley DSA Labor Branch Goals

# Who We Are

The Lehigh Valley Democratic Socialists of America Labor Working Group (LVDSA LWG) formed in 2017 in our chapter’s infancy and during a time of transition for the labor movement and working class. After decades of labor unions operating largely as service centers for contract disputes and slush funds for the Democratic Party, we see the dire need of labor to become expressly socialist to build a movement that fights for all working people.

We are an intersectional group of labor militants who are actively rebuilding the labor movement from the ground-up through organizing the unorganized and strengthening the power of the organized rank-and-file worker. We demand a proactive labor movement, both nationally and locally, that can combat worker exploitation and respond to the new economy of fissured workplaces. We believe that in order to overthrow capitalism we need to build a militant movement of labor activists.

As Democratic Socialists, we bring an alternative vision of what the labor movement can be.  Through socialism, we are determined to win the democratic control of the means of production and democracy in the workplace. We are building a socialist movement to push for broader justice for all workers.

Nationally, we are at a turning point for Socialism and the labor movement, with growing numbers of socialists everyday and the rapid increase of strikes. Locally, we have an incredible toolbox of labor militancy to build off of, from the UAW and LIUNA Strikes to the Bangor School Board in support of the Bangor Teachers. We are using this power to fight for a better world.

**Three strategies to focus our work on. These are not mutually exclusive.**

1. Organize the Unorganized
2. Rank and File Strategy
3. Strike Support

# General Goals

## Long Term

- Have labor branch members embedded into chapter campaigns to help bring a labor focused lense
- A socialist labor movement

## Medium Term

- Continue to recruit working class members to DSA through labor organizing and provide them poli ed

## Short Term

- Survey members on their employment status, etc

# Organize the Unorganized

***What is “Organize the Unorganized” and Why is it Important:***  
The last 60 years of neoliberal political economics have resulted in the largest transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich ever seen - a key strategy of capitalists during this time has been relentless attacks on unions. Massive numbers of workers are non-union (90%) - any labor strategy seeking to abolish capitalism must focus on helping support ‘unorganized’ (non-union) workers. This looks like many different things - ranging from helping workers in hot shops gain meaningful wins that may not lead directly to unionization but improve the material condition of workers’ lives to helping workers form new unions / joining an existing local. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the DSLC (Democratic Socialist Labor Commission) launched the Essential Worker Organizing Committee (EWOC) to help support such workers, helping gain support for low-wage workers around the country. 

## Long Term Goals (five ish?)

- New organizing and salting - research on union member statistics with goal of hitting certain percent
- Help the unemployed find jobs in unionized and democratic workplaces
- general strike, Bitch!

## Medium Term Goals (1 - 2 years)

- Continue to recruit working class members to DSA through labor organizing and provide them poli ed
- Build a structure that drives labor work through DSA and generates organizers
- Identify non-union industries that are hot shops or potential for salting, or gaining workplace gains that could eventually lead to unionization work towards a job 

## Short Term Goals (immediately)

- Expand data gathering to understand other existing labor coalitions and projects that are non-union
- Organize Labor Notes style training for workers affected by COVID and beyond
- Continue to support striking workers through a strike & solidarity committee & volunteering with EWOC
- Create a ‘Rapid Response Team’ of responders to immediately support workers
- Save the USPS campaign
- Work with the Lehigh Valley Coalition for Equity, LVSU, and Labor 4 Black Lives on the People's Budget (Defund The Police)
- Survey branch to understand people’s employment
- Create network of EWOC and other unorganized members to discuss non-union labor organizing strategies, struggles, etc

# Rank and File Strategy

***What is the Rank and File Strategy and Why It’s important***  
The rank and file strategy is a long term socialist strategy to organize the working class. The rank-and-file strategy argues that socialists’ central focus when we work in the labor movement should be to identify and help grow the rank-and-file leaders who can organize in the workplace every day. We work alongside the leaders who are already there to fight the boss and transform their unions. It’s when people are in motion that they become open to bigger ideas, including socialist ideas. This is how we grow our movement and build a base in the working class.

## Decision and Deliberation Process

1. Rank and file committee discussion  
⇩  
2. Branch Discussion  
⇩  
3. General Membership-- or Organizing Committee

## Long Term Goals
- Militant left in the rank and file of unions and social movement unionism
- Union politics reflect socialist politics
- Shift the values of local/national DSA towards embracing labor as a foundational strategy.

## Medium Term Goals
- Decide on key industries or workplaces where rank and file can be strengthened 
- Develop structure for linking socialists to union jobs 
- Political education on the rank and file strategy 
- Make alliances with people in different units of the same union. Building coalitions of disparate groups. 
- Political education 
- Linking unions to other social movement activism 
- Where we have a concentration of DSA members, recruiting coworkers into DSA. Build beyond just DSA
- Make our unions what we want them to be. Build movements in union--i.e. political action committees in unions.
- Bring political education into the workplaces, developing stewards, workplace organizing, union actions  
- Debate strategy in full view of general membership meeting. 
- Publicize our wins to the general membership.

## Short Term Goals
- Develop structure and leadership of rank and file committee
- Identify DSA members looking for work through survey or phonebanks 
- Follow up with Chicago NYC and Philly DSA on their process 
- Follow up with Chicago NYC and Philly DSA on their process 
- Starting a Labor 101 Poli Ed program
- Write a resolution to the OC encouraging DSA members to get jobs at union workplaces, fostering debate on the issue. 

# Strike Support

***What is Strike Support and Why is it Important:***  
Supporting strikes means being a solid resource for workers who are on strike or engaged in a work action. It means following their lead and working to keep up momentum, increase pressure on their employer, and improve morale. Strike support includes showing up at picket lines but it also means publicizing their demands and connecting them to other struggles, finding other allies and expanding the network of strike supporters to show all workers that they are a part of a much larger community of labor and working class people and that we can, and will, support one another.

We do this work because the strike is the strongest tool that organized workers have. When a group of workers refuse to work to have management address their demands, they are seizing power and showing not only their bosses but other workers that when they act collectively, they can win. As socialists, we support striking workers because it takes not only the action of workers withholding their labor to achieve wins, it takes pressure from the whole community.

## Long Term Goals

- A Lehigh Valley wide strike that wins
- Tie strike asks to clear socialist goals
- More strikes with “common good” asks
- Have labor branch members embedded into chapter campaigns to help bring a labor focused lense

## Medium Term Goals

- Prepare all LVDSA members (not just Labor Branch members) on proper picket line etiquette as well as how to help organize formal teach-ins and informal political education on the picket line
- Keep the labor branch and chapter updated on current labor priorities        
- Having a pool of rank and file members act as a resource for relevant organizing in their field

## Short Term Goals

- Create a Rapid response labor support team
- Start a general strike fund
- Strike while it’s hot training or strike-focused branch meeting
- Restating labor branch’s intention during meetings for framing
- Reacting to Covid-19 strikes and support efforts as they occur
- Create webinar/supportive efforts
- Work with JWJ and Amazonians United on their campaign locally
- Work with Workers United on a salt program
