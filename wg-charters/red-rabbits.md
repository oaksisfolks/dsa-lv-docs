Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits Charter
=================================

***Lehigh Valley Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America***

DRAFT: NOT ADOPTED

---

# ARTICLE I. Definition & Purpose

## Section 1. Definition

The Red Rabbits is the official marshaling and security team of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), consisting of a national working group (Red Rabbits National) that focuses primarily on training and local chapters that do the bulk of the frontline work. The Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits is one such local chapter formed within the Lehigh Valley Chapter of the DSA (LVDSA). 

## Section 2. Purpose

As has been the case across the country, LVDSA and our allies have experienced an upsurge of tense confrontations with police and right wing protesters. Concern for the safety of our members and allies is legitimate, as is the concern that these tense confrontations will dissuade people from expressing their fundamental right to protest injustice and work toward a better world. The Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits aims to be a reliable source of nonviolent resistance against these threats by providing marshaling and security services for LVDSA and our allied organizations. These services include:

- Marshaling,
- De-escalation,
- Security and contingency planning,
- Physical and information security,
- Contingency planning,
- Cop/ICE watch,
- Jail support,
- Training in all of the above.

# ARTICLE II. Structure

## Section 1. Rank and File Control

To the fullest extent allowed by the LVDSA Bylaws, the Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits will be controlled by its rank and file members. There will be no formal hierarchy, although membership may decide to delegate certain tasks to specialists when it is prudent. For example, if a member is a trained medic, membership can decide to delegate medical responsibilities to them. The aim is to respect expertise without giving some members power over others.

To prevent informal hierarchies from forming within the group, Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits will commit to training its members equitably. Members are expected to share their skills and knowledge with each other so as to not make themselves "essential" to the general operation of the group. 

## Section 2: Decision-Making

Although there is no formal hierarchy, the decision-making process for the Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits will not be structureless. Decisions will be made primarily by consensus in order to achieve the unity necessary to effectively resist the threats we face as left wing activists. 

If consensus cannot be reached on a proposal by a deadline, the proposal may be passed with a two-thirds majority no more than 48 hours before the deadline. 

## Section 3. Team Liaisons

The Bylaws of the LVDSA of America requires working groups to elect "lead organizers." To fulfill this obligation, the Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits will elect up to two team liaisons every 6 months. Team liaisons will be responsible for maintaining lines of communication between the Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits, Red Rabbits National, the LVDSA Steering Committee, LVDSA membership, and allied organizations.

Liaisons will have no special decision-making powers.

## Section 4. Membership

Membership in Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits is available to all members in good standing.

Non-voting membership is open to left wing activists who are not members in good standing of LVDSA with the consent of all voting Red Rabbits. 

# ARTICLE III. Conduct

## Section 1. Harassment

Red Rabbits are expected to abide by both [DSA's National Harassment Policy](https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/harassment-policy-resolution-33/) and LVDSA's Code of Conduct. 

No person who is the subject of a formal grievance or accountability process within DSA or our allied organizations is allowed membership in Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits. 

No person who has been expelled from or formally disciplined by DSA or our allied organizations for harassment is allowed membership in Lehigh Valley Red Rabbits.

## Section 2. Peace Policing

Red Rabbits are prohibited from "peace policing" or attempting to tamp down on militancy when engaged in marshaling or security roles.
