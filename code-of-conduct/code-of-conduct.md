# Code of Conduct

## Preamble

The Lehigh Valley Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (the Local Chapter) is committed to engendering a climate of respect for the variety of experience, analysis, and opinion that exists among those already in our ranks and those whom we stand alongside in the struggle for a democratic and socialist society. As a rule, the Local Chapter will be as accommodating and inclusive as practicable.

Rigorous debate is one of the hallmarks of any socialist organization. Such debate elicits the fullest political commitment and input from each member in order to develop the consensus needed to organize locally and nationally. We expect debates to be conducted with civility and respect, as comrades committed to the same struggle. 

We are, however, a socialist organization, so we expect members to be socialists or leftists interested in learning more about socialism. At a minimum, we expect each other to be open-minded about socialism. We want to create a vibrant space of open debate and discussion, but we see little to be gained by engaging with apologists for capitalism, neoliberalism, and imperialism. We will not tolerate far right-wing ideologies, such as fascism. We will take seriously actions grounded in white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, such as Blue Lives Matter and pro-life politics. This especially applies to active leaders in the Local Chapter.

## Purpose

The goal of the Code of Conduct is to foster a community that has the following qualities:

* Provides a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment where all are free to fully express their ideas and identities free from discrimination or harassment.

* Defaults to openness.

* Presumes the value of others and cherishes everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions.

* Encourages participants to listen as much as they speak, ask respectful questions, and demystify subject matter.

* Works to prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the political process.

* Ensures that relationships and conversations remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

## The Code

Members are expected to not only abide by rules of membership but should also abide by democratic norms and principles of non-discrimination. Members are accountable for actions that bring serious harm to other members, to allies, or to the organization. Discrimination may include, but is not limited to, restricting engagement in the organization or the community that surrounds it on the basis of the following traits:

* Race, ethnicity, or color.

* Religion, spirituality, or lack thereof.

* Sex, sexual orientation, marital status, or gender identity/expression.

* National origin, language of preference, or immigration status.

* Age, disability, or physical appearance.

* Military status.

* Socio-economic status, source of income, or workplace.

* Neurotypicality.

Harassment is prohibited and includes conduct which is verbal, written, physical, or via electronic communication, that has the intent or effect, because of its severity and/or persistence, to be intimidating, hostile, or offensive. Harassment may include, but is not limited to:

* Violence, or threats, calls to, or incitement thereof.

* Repeated unsolicited and/or unwanted advances, propositions, attention, or physical contact, sexual or otherwise.

* Stalking.

* Imagery, language, or other behavior that is intended to be disturbing or provocative without contributing to discussion.

## Enforcement

Wherever possible, personal conflicts should be resolved on an individual basis or with the help of the Local Chapter's Organizing Committee. Given that the aim of building a socialist organization includes building a shared sense of solidarity, disciplinary infractions should be handled with the aim of changing a member’s improper behavior, rather than resorting to formal disciplinary procedures.

Article III, Section 2 of the Bylaws provides the framework for formal disciplinary procedures. The provisions of the Code of Conduct are meant to be a substantive limit on the Local Chapter's disciplinary powers, in that they provide criteria and guidelines by which the Local Chapter shall exercise those powers. The Code of Conduct should be seen as an addendum to the rules setforth in Article XIV of the Bylaws. It does not replace any language therein.
